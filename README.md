### Hey, I'm Romario ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript Engineer from Jamaica ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² in love with React and Node. I currently work on payment gateways stuff for tumblr and wordpress.com
Before that I worked at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), I was a startup founder working on creating risk models utilizing alternative data to underwrite loans to US importers.

If I'm not coding, I'm likely running, gyming hanging out with friends or on a beach somewhere.
